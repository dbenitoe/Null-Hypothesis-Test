# Null-Hypothesis-Test
•	Conducted a statistical analysis on the log returns of American Express (AXP), Caterpillar (CAT), and Starbucks (SBUX) stock prices to test if their mean returns were significantly different from zero.
•	Performed t-tests for each stock, cleaning and processing historical data to calculate log returns and test the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.
•	Results: For AXP (t-statistic: 1.66, p-value: 0.099), CAT (t-statistic: 0.43, p-value: 0.667), and SBUX (t-statistic: -0.66, p-value: 0.508), the null hypothesis was not rejected, indicating no significant difference from a mean return of zero.
